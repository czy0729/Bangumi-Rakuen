Think of this merely as a technical necessity. This username will be used only for connecting with other users (friending) and telling users apart when you check their profiles. They’ll be limited to lowercase characters (a-z), numbers (0-9) and two special characters (period and underscore). They’ll be much easier to remember, verbalize and share with your friends. You’ll be able to continue to change your username, but not too frequently.</q></div>But...why????
