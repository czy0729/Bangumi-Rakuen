Huh! I guess people change! So I met up with her, and asked her what changed her mind on LGBTQ folks. She said, paraphrased:<br><br>\"What do you mean, Nick? [sic] I've always supported LGBTQ people.\"<br><br>Me: [silence]<br><br>Her: \"It's true! I tell all my coworkers I'm so proud to have raised & supported an LGBTQ son!
