When touch \"sign in\" in menu->settings, page about:accounts?action=signin&entrypoint=preferences turn up. Blue circle turns round and round forever. Connect remote debug and set #remote iframe opacity from 0 to 1, submit the underlying accounts.firefox.com/signin?entrypoint=preferences&service=sync&context=fx_icecatmobile_v1 form, the firefox account settings emerge. But sync is not set up! Icecat stay in this about:accounts tab, show no notification. What raise my suspect is in firefox account settings under section \"Devices&apps\", it lists a \"Current session\" as \"Web Session, Firefox Mobile 60\". Why is it some web session instead of a \"current device\"?
