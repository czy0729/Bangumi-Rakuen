The bulk of Roadfilm is made up of three overlapping components: a found cartoon of a fox fleeing from dogs; an image of a face; and dense clusters of soft, multicoloured lights. Roadfilm embraces a confusion of screen space, as this found cartoon loop will flip horizontally again and again to create mirrors and symmetries, compositions that impose on the eye an intent triangular shape, and it will force the fox to dance, swapping its bearing in a show of futility. Lawder challenges the geometric revelations of symmetry through superimpositions—even as the red and blue tints that overtake the cartoon reinforce its graphic character, reducing symbol to shape and line. Lawder was drawn to film for the same reasons as the modern painters he had studied: its kinetic dynamism and its fantasy, what he called “a conjuring up of strange and unexpected happenings.” The hallucinatory power of cinema was often linked in his films to the apparatus itself, nowhere more implicitly than in his collage films, this, Dangling Participle, Construction Job, Runaway. Runaway shares its subject with Roadfilm, albeit with a different source film: in it a cartoon pack of dogs prick up their ears and dash in a loop, the loop transforming over time. The puckish comedy of Lawder’s work is present as well, with his use of The Beatles’s “Why Don’t We Do It in the Road,” a laddish gag in its original context, there’s something both comically futile and rebellious about repurposing the lyric “no one will be watching us” into an underground film.","time":"2024-6-3 14:50","title":"斯蒂芬·布鲁默评《Roadfilm》","userId":"avonlea","userName":"Blackwell","userSign":"(不解释 你懂的)"}
