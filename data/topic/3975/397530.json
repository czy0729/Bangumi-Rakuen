That's why people believe in science, its universality and believe it will lead us to the truth of nature. I'd like to understand it as an advanced version of religion, instead of spiritual power, we use facts and reasoning.<br><br>English is the best language for science because everyone all around the world can understand it. But this is just for historical reason. Science is beyond language.<br><br>PS: Social science is not science.","time":"2024-4-27 18:12","title":"why science is difficult but people love it?","userId":"johanndanieljac","userName":"Bernoulli","userSign":""}
