And a micro 4-pixel high font – as well as a 3-pixel high super-pixel font. (The only one I know of that’s ever been tried.) Super-pixel fonts use strategically placed grayscale pixels to fake anti-aliasing. As you can see below (bottom-most font) – even at just 3 pixels, it’s surprisingly readable. If you squint. And have good eyesight.
