In the meantime, <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">you can now use the export feature to download a zipped version of up to ten waves at a time.</span><br><br>Additionally, Wave in a Box, the project to make it easy for anyone to host their own wave server, has made significant progress on both functionality and community growth. Just last week, the Apache Software Foundation accepted Wave into its incubator for new projects.<br>Thanks yet again to all our users for giving Wave a try with your schools, businesses and organizations and to the developers who are working on the next steps for the open source project!<br><br><br>——————————<br><br>今天偶然打开了wave，在左上角看到了这个。除了自己，一个在线的都没有，很凄凉的场景。<br><br>记得当初还是在wave上面跟BGM各位聊天，才得到使用twitter、翻…的方法，之后一“翻”不可收拾......<br><br>当初刚开始使用wave时，还是比较新鲜、有意思的……<br><br><img src=\"http://imgur.com/9wiue.gif\" class=\"code\" alt> ","time":"2010-12-11 15:45","title":"\"Google Wave will remain in service into 2011.\"","userId":"libex","userName":"mua","userSign":""}
