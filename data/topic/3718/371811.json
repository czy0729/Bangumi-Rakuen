Our limits were met in many areas and based on our currently lack of the staff's number, work hours, and technical capabilities, the staff believes that it will be difficult to maintain a stable and largely fair operation of ISML for much longer, unless new technical support beyond that anticipated is obtained. Therefore, the staff has decided that the 2022 edition will be the last known ISML event. We still have one last year to celebrate our favorite characters together, and we hope to make it a very special edition for everyone to enjoy.<br><br>> 机翻：但最终，一切都会走到尽头。我们在很多方面都达到了极限，基于我们目前对工作人员数量、工作时间和技术能力的缺乏，我们认为，除非获得超出预期的新技术支持，否则很难在更长时间内维持 ISML 的稳定和基本公平的运作。因此，工作人员决定，2022 年将是最后一次已知的 ISML 活动。我们还有最后一年的时间来共同庆祝我们最喜爱的角色，我们希望能把它变成一个非常特别的版本，让大家都能享受到。 ","time":"2022-7-25 11:24","title":"2022 年的 ISML 是最后一届了","userId":"317704","userName":"NekoNull","userSign":""}
