Plan B is a fairly major design/coding/setup undertaking that I'm mostly advising on, and could easily take another week to complete.</q></div>---<br>Update：站长更新了对Plan B的描述，相对之前明了些了。而且暂时不打算关站了。<div class=\"quote\"><q>Update 4: Work is proceeding on Plan B to provide additional long-term resiliency. <br><br>On a personal note, I would like to thank the community in general as well as some select fellow site administrators (who may not want to be named?) for the support over the last week. This is of course the internet, but overall, the feedback and communication has been far more positive and constructive than I would have ever expected. While some core issues remain, there are no plans to shut anything down at this point, but it should be emphasized that this website - and most websites like it - ultimately have a truck factor of 1. Changing that would be very difficult for several reasons, which means that there should always be usable and independent copies of any valuable data available.</q></div> ","time":"2019-8-2 16:34","title":"【喜讯】ExHentai活了","userId":"neko_aria","userName":"𝒩𝑒𝓀𝑜_𝒜𝓇𝒾𝒶","userSign":"(ᓚᘏᗢ_(:3」∠)_翼酱です～银发红瞳赛高！ ...)"}
