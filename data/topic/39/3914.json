There have been reports of cases among a small number of females as well.<br><br>The cause of these complications has been traced to a mysterious energy emitted from the vocal chords of Kana Hanazawa, to which researchers have labeled ℳℴℯ❤. ℳℴℯ❤ causes spasms and high blood pressure on initial contact, and prolonged exposure leads to health complications which can be fatal. Medical experts noted that the symptoms of the complications that arise include acute nose bleeding, perpetuating grunts, chest muscle contractions, nutbladder inflammation, involuntary ejaculation, and even cardiac arrest.<br><br>There is currently no treatment to this affliction, and the public has been adviced to stay away from the vocal range radius of Kana Hanazawa until further notice.
