Microprocessor, or microcontroller, is one of the most important and widely used Integrated Circuits in our life.<br>“o” in “oxic” means oxygen. “0” is a deviated form of “o” and this is our “originality”. Oxygen is an essential resource for life, like originality is an essential drive for scientific research.<br><br>“IC” means Integrated Circuits. “x” in “0xic” means multiplex. Hence 0xIC is “Originality multiplies Integrated Circuits”. Multiplication expands the signal complexity and is one of the most basic process in electronics design [2]. This implies with the help of original thinking and research, IC’s functionality and importance will be greatly enhanced.<br><br>“0xIC” is short, easy to pronounce, and for sure, easy to remember for all the electronics professionals and academics. It is original; you will not find a second “0xic” in your google search [3]. It will be one of the big names in the academia and industry. <br><br>[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0x<br>[2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing<br>[3] http://www.google.com/search?q=0xIC<br><br>各位有什么好主意没？ ","time":"2009-10-14 15:38","title":"学校的新IC实验室向社会征集名称","userId":"bernkastel","userName":"茶具","userSign":"(greetings from the ocean)"}
