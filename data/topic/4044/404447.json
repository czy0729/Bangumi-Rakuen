Creating better products that provide an improved user experience and fostering competition to drive the market to enhance products is something we are very happy about. Now that everything has improved… it is also time for us to say goodbye...It is difficult to part with something we have invested so much effort and passion into, but it is something we need to do. Thank you for standing by and supporting us throughout this time!<br><br>Every game must have an end...and life is about experiences. Every mistake teaches us lessons that help us grow.<br><br>If possible, please use legal paid services. It’s something we should do to show our respect for creators and content producers.<br><br>Good bye!<br>---------<br>You can quickly back up your bookmarks if needed before Aniwave is completely closed.<br>Go to profile page - Reddit - Discord","time":"2024-8-27 19:58","title":"aniwave怎么停了","userId":"795351","userName":"don0","userSign":""}
