Now, when I say that many academics – and indeed many commentators (academic or not) on the intellectual life of our culture – felt strongly that Derrida was not the sort of person who ought to receive an academic honour, I do not want to make this sound like they thought his work was wrong or confused or mistaken on fundamental points or objectionable for some other run-of-the-mill academic reason. No, they did not merely have objections to Derrida's work – they were infuriated by it, and protectively incensed by its dubious appeal to bright young minds. <span style=\"font-weight:bold;\">As the self-authorized champions of the classical heritage, the comparison will only grate those involved, but the aggressive denunciations and hostility directed at Derrida's work surely offers a contemporary glimpse into the frame of mind that led to Socrates being tried and convicted by the courts of democratic Athens on a charge of corrupting the youth and disbelieving in the ancestral gods.</span><br><br>疑问:<div class=\"quote\"><q>As the self-authorized champions of the classical heritage, the comparison ...</q></div>是不是和主语不相符? the comparison 能作为 champions 吗? 然后这里的comparison是指的和什么的comparison?<br>为什么champions是复数? 这里comparison明明是单数的.
