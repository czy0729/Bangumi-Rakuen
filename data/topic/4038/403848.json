Combat is fantastic thanks to a great balance of careful resource management and lightning-fast, twitch-reaction gameplay that tested my skills as much as Elden Ring ever has, despite being a more traditional action game than FromSoftware’s style. Not only that, but there are a ton of exciting boss battles, a great variety of enemies, and the world they inhabit is an absolute treat for the eyes and ears. Its story has its moments but relies a bit too much on having prior knowledge of the events of Journey to the West, and it really could have used a map to make its rewarding exploration measure up to the strength of its combat. That said, its strengths more than carry it through, making Black Myth: Wukong a great action game that could be even greater if GameScience can squash the bugs.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------<br>中国区的评测这是通稿吗？<br><img src=\"https://iili.io/dGuxOS2.png\" class=\"code\" rel=\"noreferrer\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" alt>","time":"2024-8-16 23:10","title":"黑猴IGN 8分，不如原神","userId":"726165","userName":"Comrade","userSign":"(沙超球迷)"}
