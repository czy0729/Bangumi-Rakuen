To prove that you are the Ultimate Otaku, it’s your job to identify 50 items and their corresponding anime/manga/game. You have precisely 24 HOURS to claim your title!<br><br>RULES:<br><br>Send me a NOTE with the items identified. Can’t find all 50? Send in your answers anyway; if no one is able to reach 50 then the person with the most items identified will win. If you do not know what the item is called, but know what anime it’s from, mention where it is found in the picture.<br><br>*PLEASE do NOT post your answers in the comments below.<br><br>You can work with as many people as you want but keep in mind that the prize will remain the same. I will look through the notes after 12 hours, and no winner will be announced until the contest is over.<br><br>答出来了去他的页面用中文嘲讽他吧！<br><br><a href=\"http://hitsukuya.deviantart.com/art/Ultimate-Otaku-174534205\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener\" class=\"l\">http://hitsukuya.deviantart.com/art/Ultimate-Otaku-174534205</a> ","time":"2011-6-17 19:57","title":"[宅度挑战]Are YOU the Ultimate Otaku?","userId":"eachgo","userName":"eachgo","userSign":"(太懒了，还轮不到拼天赋呢。)"}
