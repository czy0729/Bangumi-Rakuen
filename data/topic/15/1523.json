Fans of anime like Lain or Ghost in the Shell would probably be this kind.<br>Type B:<br>A person who simply enjoys “characters.”<br>Will watch an anime if it includes cute or beautiful characters.<br>Doesn’t care if story is awful, as long as the characters are of interest.<br>Evaluates anime based on which seiyuu are in it and what the characters look like.<br>Loves moe elements. Doesn’t like complex anime.<br>The otaku the media picks up on are usually this kind.<br>Doesn’t know that much about anime and so is often criticised as by Type A otaku.<br>However, they make much better customers than the more discerning Type A otaku.<br>Recently there has been a huge increase in anime targeted at Type B otaku.<br>People who like K-ON!, Queen’s Blade, Strike Witches and so on would be in this class.<br>In fairness “Type A” seems more a description of anime “fans” than anime “otaku,” as most of the irrational and obsessive characteristics generally associated with otaku seem to be absent; on the other hand, it is in the hearts of “Type B” otaku that the seeds of the moe boom were sown…<br>Anime lovers will inevitably have to ask “Which type am I?”<br><br>－ －翻译能力很差，跪求翻译文<br><br>偶这种Type A日益觉得和Type B无语了<br>虽然都是otaku ","time":"2010-1-17 19:17","title":"“The Two Types of Anime Otaku”","userId":"chakane048","userName":"最終鬼畜兵器Pro","userSign":"(The Ultimate Redemption)"}
