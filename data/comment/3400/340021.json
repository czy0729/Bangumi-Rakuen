brotherhood.<br>I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.<br>I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.<br>I have a dream today.<br>I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; one day

A journey back in the early days of our beloved game. A journey in which hundreds of thousands of people took part in together. Something that we had never seen before, either on retail or private servers. Together, we built a strong community, sharing values and a commun genuine interest for this wonderful game created by Blizzard.<br><br>Yesterday, we received a letter of formal notice from US and french lawyers, acting on behalf of Blizzard Entertainment, preparing to stand trial against our hosting company OVH and ourselves in less than a week now. This means the de facto end of Nostalrius under its current form.<br><br>As soon as we received this letter, we decided to inform the team and players about the future of Nostalrius, where we have all passionately committed our time and energy as volunteers.<br><br>Nostalrius Begins PvP, Nostalrius Begins PvE & Nostalrius TBC and all related servers will be definitively shutdown at 23:00 server time on the 10th of April 2016, if our hosting company keeps the server online for that long. It feels kind of unreal, but we want to continue to serve our players as we did, and the best we can in the remaining time.<br><br>What will happen next? This time, we have no plan for the future, and will have to rely entirely on our community and/or the private server scene.<br><br>We know the time you spent here, the guilds you were part of, and these people with whom you have shared experiences with. We know the strength of these links, and we also know that they do not need a special WoW realm to survive. However, we will still be publicly providing everything needed in order to setup your own “Nostalrius” if you are willing to.<br><br>Today is also the day where Nostalrius will start being community-driven in the truest sense of the word, as we will be releasing the source code, and anonymized players data (encrypting personal account data), so the community as a whole will decide the form of the future of Nostalrius. We will still be there in the background if you want us to, but will no longer take the lead.<br><br>We also initiated an open letter addressed to Blizzard, that you can read and forward if you want. It won’t bring Nostalrius back, but it is a way to express ourselves as a community.<br><br>Nostalrius was all about the nostalgia and memories of the glorious vanilla days. We don’t know if you truly felt like it was the glory days while playing here, but we hope that you will keep good memories of the time spent here. Once again, we can all be proud to have been part of the Nostalrius journey, no matter how much time was actually spent “in-game”.","sub":[{"avatar":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/user/m/000/03/15/31568.jpg","floor":"#10-1","id":"1148170","time":"2016-4-8 11:27","userId":"haohao69","userName":"好好","userSign":"","message":"没太看明白，这是个社区演讲？关于玩游戏的社会演讲？"}]},{"avatar":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/user/m/000/00/35/3556.jpg","floor":"#11","id":"1148162","time":"2016-4-8 11:17","userId":"lovee","userName":"星野恵瑠","userSign":"(Miata Is Always The Answer!)","message":"Stay hungry, stay foolish<img src=\"/img/smiles/tv/01.gif\" smileid=\"40\" alt=\"(bgm24)\"><br><a href=\"http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMjY1MjQyMDI0.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener\" class=\"l\">http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMjY1MjQyMDI0.html</a>","sub":[{"avatar":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/user/m/000/03/15/31568.jpg","floor":"#11-1","id":"1148172","time":"2016-4-8 11:32","userId":"haohao69","userName":"好好","userSign":"","message":"看到了过世的人，先祷告一下吧:一路走好"}]},{"avatar":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/user/m/000/01/42/14268.jpg","floor":"#12","id":"1148210","time":"2016-4-8 13:40","userId":"calfn","userName":"触触✅个人认证","userSign":"","message":"贴近生活，就写你在茫茫bgm中找到一个很有趣的薰薰，然后写薰薰就好了哦","sub":[]},{"avatar":"//lain.bgm.tv/pic/user/m/000/24/35/243595.jpg","floor":"#13","id":"1148215","time":"2016-4-8 14:27","userId":"243595","userName":"darkangel0224","userSign":"(我是一个路人)","message":"Today I'd like to talk about Barack H. Obama who is the 44th President of the United States.<br><br>His story is the American story — values from the heartland, a middle-class upbringing in a strong family, hard work and education as the means of getting ahead, and the conviction that a life so blessed should be lived in service to others.<br><br>With a father from Kenya and a mother from Kansas, President Obama was born in Hawaii on August 4, 1961. He was raised with help from his grandfather, who served in Patton's army, and his grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management at a bank.<br><br>After working his way through college with the help of scholarships and student loans, President Obama moved to Chicago, where he worked with a group of churches to help rebuild communities devastated by the closure of local steel plants.<br><br>He went on to attend law school, where he became the first African—American president of the Harvard Law Review. Upon graduation, he returned to Chicago to help lead a voter registration drive, teach constitutional law at the University of Chicago, and remain active in his community.<br><br>President Obama's years of public service are based around his unwavering belief in the ability to unite people around a politics of purpose. In the Illinois State Senate, he passed the first major ethics reform in 25 years, cut taxes for working families, and expanded health care for children and their parents. As a United States Senator, he reached across the aisle to pass groundbreaking lobbying reform, lock up the world's most dangerous weapons, and bring transparency to government by putting federal spending online.<br><br>He was elected the 44th President of the United States on November 4, 2008, and sworn in on January 20, 2009. He and his wife, Michelle, are the proud parents of two daughters, Malia, 14, and Sasha, 11.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/presidents/barackobama\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener\" class=\"l\">https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/presidents/barackobama</a>","sub":[]}]
